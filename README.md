# REST-API-USING-PYTHON
I create an REST-API using micro frame work of python called Flask. In which I create a database using mysql to store data into a table.
To insert and retrieve the records from the database table. 

## Technologies used
* **[Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** - A programming language that lets you work more quickly (The universe loves speed!).
* **[Flask](flask.pocoo.org/)** - A microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions


## Installation / Usage
* If you wish to run your own build, first ensure you have python3 globally installed in your computer. If not, you can get python3 [here](https://www.python.org).
